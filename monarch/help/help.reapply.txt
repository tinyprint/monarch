Usage:
  go run github.com/tinyprint/monarch reapply <name>

<name> can be the name of the migration (including timestamp) or a path to the
migration.

Using a path to the migration is merely a convenience so autocomplete
can be used on the command line. The path and file extension are dropped before
finding the migration is reapplied. This prevents migrations from a directory
outside the defined migration directory from being ran.
